    title: Responsible Responsive Design
    author: Scott Jehl
    description: "While responsive design has immeasurably improved multi-device and multi-browser visual layout, many responsive development challenges remain. How does your design adapt to changing bandwidth rates and device capabilities? How do you serve the right content in the right context? What does mobile really mean? Harnessing deep experience in the evolution of responsive web design, Scott Jehl illuminates the answers to these questions (and more!) and guides you through building for a truly future-friendly experience."
